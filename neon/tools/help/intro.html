<h1>Editor basics</h1>
<h2>Engine and editor limits</h2>
The engine has the following limits when it comes to mods, maps and entities:
<ul>
	<li>the maximum number of mods that can be loaded simultaneously is 2<sup>15</sup> - 1.
	<li>every mod can contain up to 2<sup>16</sup> maps, each with 2<sup>32</sup> zones.
	<li>every map can contain 2<sup>32</sup> entities (items or creatures).
</ul>
Random generation has the following limits:
<ul>
	<li>2<sup>31</sup> random maps can be generated.
	<li>2<sup>63</sup> random entities can be generated.
</ul>

<h2>Files</h2>
Normally, a mod is distributed as a single .jar file. The engine and editor can both load a .jar
file, but the editor cannot edit or save a .jar file directly. To adapt an existing mod, first
unjar it (7-zip and other archivers can handle .jar files, but the editor has an unpack tool too), 
then load the unjarred directory in the editor. The engine can also load directories, so for testing, 
no .jar of your mod is necessary. To package a mod in a .jar for distribution, the editor includes a 
pack tool. 
<p>
Two types of mods exist. The first one is a <i>master</i>. This type of mod can be used all by
itself. The second is an <i>extension</i>. This type of mod references another extension or a
master mod, and is only usable when all referenced mods are present in the neon.ini file. 
<p>
The editor can export a map to an SVG file. This has no purpose other than showing of your map making 
skills on the interwebs.

<h2>Loading a mod</h2>
To load an existing mod, select <b>File &gt; Load...</b>. There are two possibilities: 1) if the mod
is packed in a .jar file, just select the .jar file and click <b>Open</b>; 2) if the mod hasn't 
been packed yet, select the folder containing the mod (just select it with a single click, do not open 
the folder by double clicking), and click <b>Open</b>.
<p>
If the selected mod is an extension mod, the editor will attempt to load all referenced mods. if
this is not possible, loading will fail. Make sure all referenced mods are present in the neon.ini 
file.
<p>
Only mods contained in a folder can be edited. Any changes to a mod in a .jar file will not be 
saved. 

<h2>Creating a new mod</h2>
If you wish to create a new master mod, select <b>File &gt; New &gt; Master module...</b> and
choose an existing folder (or create one) where your mod will be saved. Again, select the folder
with a single click, do not open it by double clicking.
<p>
If you wish to create an extension mod, select <b>File &gt; New &gt; Extension module...</b> 
and first choose a master that will be referenced by your new extension. Next, choose a folder 
where the extension will be saved. All entities, maps, etc. in the master mod(s) will be available 
in the extension. They will be shown in <i>italics</i>.
<p>
The name of the folder you selected for your mod will also become the <i>id</i> of your mod, 
which must be unique. Attempting to load two mods with the same id will result in unexpected
errors.

<h2>Saving a mod</h2>
Simply select <b>File &gt; Save</b> to save a mod. After saving , you may select <b>Tools &gt; Pack
mod...</b> to pack your mod in a .jar file for distribution. Other tools can be used to pack a mod,
but you will have to include a manifest file with a <i>Mod-ID: &lt;id of your mod&gt;</i> attribute.
