<h1>Map editing</h1>
<h2>Map management</h2>
All available maps are shown in a tree on the left side of the main editor screen. Each map can contain
several zones. Outdoor (world) maps always have a single zone. Indoor (dungeon) maps may have no zones,
in which case the complete dungeon can be randomly generated (according to a <i>dungeon theme</i>). If a 
dungeon has one or more zones, these may be <i>fixed</i> (no random content) or <i>random</i> (randomly 
generated according to a <i>zone theme</i>).
<p>
To add a map, right click on the map tree and choose <b>Add map</b>. You will be asked to give an <i>id</i> 
(must be unique), an optional name (doesn't have to be unique), and map type (outdoor or indoor). For 
outdoor maps, the map width or height must be given, and the base terrain type. For indoor maps, an optional 
dungeon theme may be chosen. An outdoor map will be created with one zone present. Indoor map zones have to 
be added manually.
<p>
To edit map info, right click on a map name and choose <b>Edit map</b>. In the dialog box, the map name
and, in case of a dungeon map, the random dungeon theme can be changed. If a dungeon theme is chosen for a 
map that already contains zones, a warning will be given. Setting a theme will delete all zones.
<p>
To add a zone to a map (indoor maps only), right click on a map name and choose <b>Add zone</b>. You will
be asked for a name, width and height of the new zone and the base terrain type. A zone theme may be 
specified. In that case, the width, height and terrain values will be ignored.
<p>
To edit zone info, right click on the name and select <b>Edit zone</b>. The zone name can be changed and
a zone theme may be given. If a zone theme is specified, all zone content will be deleted. The contents
of the zone are shown in a table and can be edited. For most content, only the position can be changed. For 
doors and containers, double clicking the id opens the door or container instance editor.
<p>
To delete a zone or a map, right click on the name and select <b>Delete zone</b> or <b>Delete map</b>.

<h2>Zone editing</h2>
To view a zone, double click on its name. If it is a fixed zone, the content will be shown in the main
editing pane. If it is a random zone, you will have the option of generating the zone content from the
zone theme, or starting with a blank zone. Both options will remove the zone theme.  
<p>
To move terrain or objects (<i>instances</i>), click and drag with your mouse. To place new objects, drag 
them onto the editing pane from the object tree at the right side of the window (on the <i>Object</i> tab).
<p>
Every instance is placed on a layer. 128 layers are available. Instances on a higher layer will be shown on 
top of those on a lower layer. Layer 126 is reserved for creatures (including the player). Layer 125 is 
reserved for items. Layers 0-124 can be used for terrain. Items that have the <b>Always on top</b> property 
selected, will be shown on layer 127. In the toolbar, there is an option <b>Show only current layer</b>, 
which lets you select a single layer you would like to examine.
<p>
Zooming in and out can be done with the <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> buttons in the toolbar. The standard zoom 
level will show objects and terrain with a 12 pt font. Zooming in and out uses a factor 2. If possible, the
upper left corner of the visible area will remain in the same position after zooming.
<p>
By default, <i>Select mode</i> is active. To draw terrain, <i>Draw mode</i> must be chosen by clicking the
paintbrush in the toolbar. Clicking and dragging the mouse will now draw a piece of terrain (a <i>region</i>) 
on the layer selected in the toolbar. The type of terrain can be selected from the list at the right side of 
the window (on the <i>Terrain</i> tab).
<p>
The last operation performed can be undone by clicking the undo button in the toolbar.
<p>
Right clicking on instances opens a context menu. Choose <b>Cut</b> or <b>Copy</b> to cut and copy, choose 
<b>Paste</b> to paste it on the required position. <b>Delete</b> removes an object or terrain from the 
current zone.

<h2>Instance properties</h2>
Terrain and certain objects offer the <b>Properties...</b> option in their context menu. This allow editing
certain properties of the selected instance.

<h3>Terrain</h3>
In the <i>Region instance editor</i>, the position and size of the selected region can be set. For regions 
on an outdoor map, an optional theme can be set. Clicking <b>Generate randomly</b> with a theme selected will
generate this type of terrain and remove the theme. Be careful when using this feature, as the generated 
terrain can be quite large with many object instances. Optional scripts can be added to a region. These 
scripts will be run when the player enters this region. To add or remove scripts, right click on the script 
area.

<h3>Containers</h3>
By default, a container has no predetermined contents. These must be added for every instance. Right clicking
on the contents area in the <i>Container instance editor</i> allows you to add or remove items.

<h3>Doors</h3>
Doors have two optional components: a <i>Lock</i> and a <i>Destination</i>. By setting the <b>lockable</b> 
property, a lock is added. The state of the door, the difficulty of the lock and the key for this lock can be 
selected. By setting the <b>portal</b> property, a destination is added. The destination map, zone and 
coordinates can be chosen. If no map is selected, the destination will be the chosen coordinates on the 
current zone. 
<p>
If the destination map or zone are random, the destination coordinates my be ignored. It is possible to 
select a dungeon theme as destination. In that case, the map, zone and coordinates are ignored.
<p>
A door sign may be given, this will be displayed when the player looks at this door.
